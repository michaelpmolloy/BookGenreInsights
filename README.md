## Background and overview 

Goodreads is a free website and app which is used by readers to track, rate and reviews books they have read. 

The website has a large database of books along with reviews and ratings which allow for trends and growth of different book genres to be identified. This project analyses and synthesises the data available on Goodreads to identify book genres which are most likely to have a high ROI in 2025 and the subsequent years.
